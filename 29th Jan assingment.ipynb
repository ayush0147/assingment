    "2. Which type of programming does python support? \n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "   Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This allows the creation of objects and\n",
    "    classes that can be used to model real-world entities.\n",
    "    Imperative Programming: This involves using statements to specify a sequence \n",
    "    of actions that the computer should perform.\n",
    "    Functional Programming: This involves treating computation as the evaluation of \n",
    "    mathematical functions, and is supported by Python's built-in functional programming \n",
    "    features like map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "    Procedural Programming: This involves breaking down a problem into a series of procedures\n",
    "    or functions to solve the problem step by step.\n",
